// Udemy=>Jackson Kailath Teacher's course=> 50days leetcode=> module 14=> LTS pair chain Russian Doll Envelopes
// You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where envelopes[i] = [wi, hi] represents the width and the height of an envelope.

// One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height.

// Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

// Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.

// Example :

// Input: envelopes = [[6,5],[7,5],[7,8],[3,4]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([3,4] => [6,5] => [7,8]).

var maxEnvelopes = function(envelopes) {
    //Write code here 
    
};
